# BoxOnWheelsVsTheWorld
During the sumer of 2016, I made a 3D game with Java using jMonkeyEngine. In it, you can control a robotic character named Boxie and help
him collect coins to move onto the next level. You also have to jump from different platforms and to earn the ability to jump, you have
collect cheese. The character and act of collecting cheese are inside jokes only funny to me. 

You can view a demo of the game here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zvf3JJrSGqZgenN_gmhMtmYCYw3V-AoL/view?usp=sharing
